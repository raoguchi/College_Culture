three years ago we decided to launch an focus our MBA around managing in a digital driven world. 
so what does that mean.
well it meant that we had to go back to the drawing board and revise our entire curriculum. 
all of our core courses were fundamentally changed.
every single one of them.
even the ones that doesn't seem on the surface to be obvious like accounting.
you know a lot of accountants will tell you accounting is accounting.
well our accounting faculty came back and said no we are changing our fundamental core class and accounting.
organizational behavior thinking about how organizations have changed as aresult of technology.
the role of virtual teams, the use of big data, again fundamentally rethinking how we deliver our core classes.
we also are in the process of deriving and getting new electives and taking electives and making them more digital savvy but also creating actually fundamentally new electives that aren't offered elsewhere.
one is a strategy elective called strategy in a digital age, which doesn't use anything off-the-shelf.
all the cases the books are all fundamentally new and it's taught by someone who's invested heavily in creating a course around how we think strategically in a digital age
and the second course deals with a particular industry with just media. and entertainment and the digital disruption in that industry we are all in our faculty voted for adopting this strategy
It was unit almost unanimously approved and it's embraced by our faculty we are living in this world things and things are changing and we as managers need to think differently
